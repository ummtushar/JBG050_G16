# Data Challenge 2 Group 16
This work is done by students from TU/e university
Some of the data that we work with could not be included into repository due to privacy concerns

## Description
This project explores data that was downloaded from London datastore. It contains data exploration, 
merging and cleaning in order to proceed wit regression

## Code structure
The code contains 4 folders

- exploring: this folder contains python files and notebooks that get insights from the data and tey to visualise it
- data merging and cleaning: this folder contains all the files that were used to clean and merge the data
- regression: this folder contains files related to regression on the final dataset 

The initial data is not included into the repository due to privacy concern. Use this repository only to validate 
methods used in order to obtain the final results and conclusions drawn from the data.

## Environment setup instructions
We recommend to set up a virtual Python environment to install the package and its dependencies. 
To install the package, we recommend to execute `pip install -r requirements.txt.` in the command line. 
This will install it in editable mode, meaning there is no need to reinstall after making changes. 
If you are using PyCharm, it should offer you the option to create a virtual environment from the requirements 
file on startup. Note that also in this case, it will still be necessary to run the pip command described above.

## METGPT 
This project explores the idea of creating  a custom Llama 3 model for MET police. This feature is currently uncompleted
