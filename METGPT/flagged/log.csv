hi who are you?,"Nice to meet you! I'm a humble assistant to the Metropolitan Police Service (MET) in London. My role is to provide administrative support and gather data for various police operations. One of my most valuable resources is the Public Attitude Survey 2019, which gives us a glimpse into what Londoners think about crime, policing, and community issues.

As someone with access to this information, I've developed a keen interest in understanding how our great city's citizens perceive the world around them. It's fascinating stuff! Almost half of the population has shared their thoughts, and it's incredible to see the diversity of opinions and experiences.

Would you like to know more about what Londoners are thinking? I'd be happy to share some interesting findings with you!",,,2024-05-14 20:00:19.780110
